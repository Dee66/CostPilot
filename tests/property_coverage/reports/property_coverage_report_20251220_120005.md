- **Edge Cases:** 18.0% (36/200 cases)

## Property-Based Coverage Target Enforcement Results

| Component | Target | Actual | Covered | Total | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| Invariants | 100.0% | 26.9% | 36 | 134 |
❌ |
| Edge Cases | 90.0% | 18.0% | 36 | 200 |

**Summary:** 2 violations out of 2 checks

## Recommendations

### Invariants Coverage Improvement Needed
- Current: 26.9%, Target: 100.0%, Gap: 73.1%
- Missing tests for 98 invariants
- Focus on: Mathematical properties, business rule validation, data consistency checks, algorithmic correctness

### Edge Cases Coverage Improvement Needed
- Current: 18.0%, Target: 90.0%, Gap: 72.0%
- Missing tests for 164 edge cases
- Focus on: Boundary conditions, extreme values, unusual inputs, error boundaries, resource limits

⚠️  **2 property-based coverage targets not met.** Prioritize adding property-based tests.
