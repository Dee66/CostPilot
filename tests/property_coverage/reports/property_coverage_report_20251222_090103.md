- **Edge Cases:** 90.0% (boundary conditions and extreme values)

## Current Coverage Status

- **Invariants:** 100.0% (146/146 invariants)
- **Edge Cases:** 34.4% (72/209 cases)

## Property-Based Coverage Target Enforcement Results

| Component | Target | Actual | Covered | Total | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| Invariants | 100.0% | 100.0% | 146 | 146 |
✅ |
| Edge Cases | 90.0% | 34.4% | 72 | 209 |
❌ |

**Summary:** 1 violations out of 2 checks

## Recommendations

### Edge Cases Coverage Improvement Needed
- Current: 34.4%, Target: 90.0%, Gap: 55.6%
- Missing tests for 137 edge cases
- Focus on: Boundary conditions, extreme values, unusual inputs, error boundaries, resource limits

⚠️  **1 property-based coverage targets not met.** Prioritize adding property-based tests.
