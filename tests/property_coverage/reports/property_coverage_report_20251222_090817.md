- **Edge Cases:** 43.1% (90/209 cases)

## Property-Based Coverage Target Enforcement Results

| Component | Target | Actual | Covered | Total | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| Invariants | 100.0% | 100.0% | 146 | 146 |
✅ |
| Edge Cases | 90.0% | 43.1% | 90 | 209 |
❌ |

**Summary:** 1 violations out of 2 checks

## Recommendations

### Edge Cases Coverage Improvement Needed
- Current: 43.1%, Target: 90.0%, Gap: 46.9%
- Missing tests for 119 edge cases
- Focus on: Boundary conditions, extreme values, unusual inputs, error boundaries, resource limits

⚠️  **1 property-based coverage targets not met.** Prioritize adding property-based tests.
