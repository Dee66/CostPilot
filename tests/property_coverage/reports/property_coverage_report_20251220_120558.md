**Summary:** 2 violations out of 2 checks

## Recommendations

### Invariants Coverage Improvement Needed
- Current: 68.7%, Target: 100.0%, Gap: 31.3%
- Missing tests for 42 invariants
- Focus on: Mathematical properties, business rule validation, data consistency checks, algorithmic correctness

### Edge Cases Coverage Improvement Needed
- Current: 18.0%, Target: 90.0%, Gap: 72.0%
- Missing tests for 164 edge cases
- Focus on: Boundary conditions, extreme values, unusual inputs, error boundaries, resource limits

⚠️  **2 property-based coverage targets not met.** Prioritize adding property-based tests.
