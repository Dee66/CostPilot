**Generated:** 2025-12-22 09:26:25

## Coverage Targets

- **Invariants:** 100.0% (mathematical properties and business rules)
- **Edge Cases:** 90.0% (boundary conditions and extreme values)

## Current Coverage Status

- **Invariants:** 100.0% (146/146 invariants)
- **Edge Cases:** 87.1% (182/209 cases)

## Property-Based Coverage Target Enforcement Results

| Component | Target | Actual | Covered | Total | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| Invariants | 100.0% | 100.0% | 146 | 146 |
✅ |
| Edge Cases | 90.0% | 87.1% | 182 | 209 |
❌ |

**Summary:** 1 violations out of 2 checks

## Recommendations

### Edge Cases Coverage Improvement Needed
- Current: 87.1%, Target: 90.0%, Gap: 2.9%
- Missing tests for 27 edge cases
- Focus on: Boundary conditions, extreme values, unusual inputs, error boundaries, resource limits

⚠️  **1 property-based coverage targets not met.** Prioritize adding property-based tests.
