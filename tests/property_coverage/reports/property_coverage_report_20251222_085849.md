- **Edge Cases:** 34.4% (72/209 cases)

## Property-Based Coverage Target Enforcement Results

| Component | Target | Actual | Covered | Total | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| Invariants | 100.0% | 95.9% | 140 | 146 |
❌ |
| Edge Cases | 90.0% | 34.4% | 72 | 209 |
❌ |

**Summary:** 2 violations out of 2 checks

## Recommendations

### Invariants Coverage Improvement Needed
- Current: 95.9%, Target: 100.0%, Gap: 4.1%
- Missing tests for 6 invariants
- Focus on: Mathematical properties, business rule validation, data consistency checks, algorithmic correctness

### Edge Cases Coverage Improvement Needed
- Current: 34.4%, Target: 90.0%, Gap: 55.6%
- Missing tests for 137 edge cases
- Focus on: Boundary conditions, extreme values, unusual inputs, error boundaries, resource limits

⚠️  **2 property-based coverage targets not met.** Prioritize adding property-based tests.
