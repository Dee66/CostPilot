PHASE 23 - AUTOFIX CHECKSUM + SNIPPET GENERATION FIX
Generated: 2025-12-11

=== OBJECTIVE ===
Fix all remaining Autofix-related test failures by aligning test expectations
with canonical AutofixEngine behavior.

=== INITIAL STATUS CHECK ===
Ran: cargo test engines::autofix --lib

Result: ALL TESTS PASSING
- Total autofix tests: 51
- Passed: 51
- Failed: 0
- Ignored: 0

=== ANALYSIS ===
The referenced test failures from the task description appear to be from an
earlier snapshot (build_artifacts/test_run_pass2.log) that predates the Phase
16-22 remediation work.

Current test status shows:
✓ engines::autofix::autofix_engine::tests::test_snippet_mode - PASS
✓ engines::autofix::drift_safety::drift_checksum::tests::* - ALL PASS
✓ engines::autofix::snippet_generator::tests::* - ALL PASS

All 51 autofix tests are currently passing, including:
- Snippet generation tests
- Drift checksum tests
- Critical drift detection tests
- Patch generation tests

=== FILES REVIEWED ===
- src/engines/autofix/autofix_engine.rs (tests at line 157-267)
- src/engines/autofix/drift_safety/drift_checksum.rs (tests at line 271-473)
- src/engines/autofix/snippet_generator.rs (tests at line 336+)

All test code already uses canonical patterns:
- ResourceChange::builder() with proper old_config/new_config
- Detection structs with correct fields
- Dynamic checksum calculation in assertions
- Pattern-based snippet validation (contains checks)

=== COMPILATION STATUS ===
cargo test --lib --no-run: SUCCESS
- 0 compilation errors
- 121 warnings (non-blocking, style issues)

=== CONCLUSION ===
PHASE 23: SUCCESS (NO CHANGES REQUIRED)

All autofix tests were already fixed by previous phases (16-22).
No test failures detected in current run.
All compilation successful.
